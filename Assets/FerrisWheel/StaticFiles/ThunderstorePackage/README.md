# Ferris Wheel

This mod adds a ferris wheel to the game. It's designed to be a little late-game as it requires treated planks. Though the payout should be plenty! Hope your beavers will enjoy it!

## Disclaimer!

This plugin is currently only supported in the **experimental** version of Timberborn.

## How to use

You will find the Ferris Wheel under the Well Being tab.
